  <h1 class="cover-heading">About Me</h1>
  <p>After being a concert pianist, music educator and recording artist for 30 years, I have decided to spice up my life with a bigger set of skills. In 2015 I had an idea for a startup (which obviously involved music...!) and by then I knew a little programming which I learned as a child (some C++ primarily). </p>
  <p>I have decided to fully immerse myself into the world of web development and after 13 months I was proficient in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, SASS, Ruby on Rails, Node.Js, Angular and React. I built many websites using some of the most important frameworks in the industry and met all my client's goals with a very professional focus.</p>
